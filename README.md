In this project, we are using the US Health Insurance Dataset taken from Kaggle. 
Our main aim is to help provide the product owner and/or pricing manager with data backed insights on key characteristics of the customer to consider while segmenting and targeting the customer base. 
Secondly, we want to predict the expected insurance charges based on the available data on the prospective customer. 
This could help in finding the right premium rate for customers helping the company to control risk undertaken.


Research Question
a)	We would like to predict the medical charges billed by insurance company using certain attributes of the insured. 

b)	Further, we would formulate hypothesis to check individual and combined impact of attributes like Age, Sex, BMI, Number of Children, Smoking, and Region on insurance charges.

c)	What are the key attributes (if any) based on which we could segment and target our customers. We want to provide underwriters with insights that could help them prepare better targeted insurance plans for the customers with different preferences and/or region of residence.

Data
a)	We are using US Health Insurance Dataset from Kaggle.

b)	The dataset contains 1338 records each record describes the data on a insured person in the US. 

c)	The insurance charges billed by insurance company are given against the following attributes of the insured: Age, Sex, BMI, Number of Children, Smoker (whether the insured person is smoker or not), and Region. 

d)	As per our knowledge, the data is of 1338 unique individuals, and it is not repeated. Also, there are no missing or undefined values in the dataset.
